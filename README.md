# 🧠 LDSM for Apple Silicon™ 🍏💾

**A HTML page that I will be connecting to my deterministic system for logic-based math, symbolic dispatching, and optimized computation… that also pretends to blow up your SSD. Feel free to steal the code cause you cant code HTML like this. Oh and please dont have a seizure.**



**✨ Features (no, you won’t be stealing my backend, optimizations not included)**
- Neural Armageddon Mode
- Built-in daemonic possession + SSD detonation protocol (beta).
- Pathfinding Goldilocks Optimization
- Tuned for ~40% maze density — the “Goldilocks Zone” where normal algorithms collapse.
- GMPY2 Flex Mode 1.5–8× speedups over GMPY2 for integers under 10^64.
- Seizure Mode because I can code it, can you?
