# LDSM for Apple Silicon‚Ñ¢ üçè  üíæ 

A **deterministic system** for logic-based math, symbolic dispatching, and **optimized** computation.



## Features

- **Neural Armageddon Mode**: Built-in daemonic possession and SSD detonation protocol
- **Pathfinding**: Optimized for the Goldilocks Zone with 40% maze density
- **GMPY2 Benchmarks**: 1.5-8x speedups compared to GMPY2 for integers under 10^64
- **Seizure Mode**: Experience the full chaos of neural collapse
